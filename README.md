# Functional programming concepts in 50 lines of code

## Introduction

I wrote a post a rather theoretical post on medium on functional programming concepts. The present post is more pragmatic in the sense that the whole code using functional programming principle of a little project is explamided.

# Functional programming

Bunch of function which are functional. Pass the necessary data to function. Make them as autonomous as possible.

# Recursion

_Do not mutate data_. Do write tail recursive function.

# Closure

Parameterized a function. Function expecting a specfic signature.

# Decorator

Parameterized a function. Function expecting a specfic signature.

# Hight order function

Expect function (callback) or returs a function.

# Isolate side effect

Programms without side-effect are very restrictive.

# Benefit of using functional programming

Less code, easier to read, easier to test.

# JavaScript and functional programming

Functional programming is a style. So any language can be use. Of course some are more adjusted for that. JavaScript by support cloure and function as first class citizen is quite adaquete for functional programming.
